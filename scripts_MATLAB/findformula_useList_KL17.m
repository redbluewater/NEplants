%%%input the following variables:
% peak_mass - list of masses 
% peak_int - intensity of each peak (can currently be set to zeros)
%
% FORMULA_ERROR is the error for the elemental formula determination by the
% function, chemform, in ppm; 
%
% RELATION_ERROR is the window allowed % for identification of a relationship 
% between two peaks, in ppm.
%
% MASS_LIMIT is the maximum mass for the brute force calculation
%
% fullCompoundList - the database of possible compounds calculated by
% K Longnecker (LongneckerKujawinski_fullCompoundList.mat); new version
% of database generated 11/2/2016
%
% sortType can be one of the following choices:
% 1) 'lowestSP' select the formula with the lowest # of S and P
% 2) 'HAcap' sorts based on the lowest number of S,P,N, and then only formulas
%       with P <= 1 or S <= 3 are considered valid
% 3) 'lowestError' to sort on the formula which has the lowest error from
%       the measured mass
% 
% This iteration % of the program uses only chemical relationships that 
% are common to refractory DOM such as humic acids. It does not include many
% biologically-relevant (i.e., metabolic) reactions.
% 
%%% The output is 
% formula : the elemental formulas for the peak list [C H O N C13 S P Na Error].
% elementOrder : a reminder of the order of elements by column

% original version of this algorithm published as: Kujawinski and Behn. 2006. 
% Automated analysis of electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion 
% cyclotron resonance mass spectra of natural organic matter. 
% Analytical Chemistry 78:4363-4373. 
% Largest change has been to use a database to find the formulas rather
% than recalculating all of the possible formulas each time.

% Last updated: November 6, 2005
% updated version received by K Longnecker from LK 8/8/08
% KL changing relations to structures 9/12/08
%%KL added 9/12/08: put in a check to make sure that the format of the data 
%%are as needed for this function. peak_int and peak_mass both need to be 
%%multiple rows and one column
%%
%KL 1/2/09 - change the list sorting to consider both the minimum number of
%non-oxygen heteroatoms AND the lowest error - get around the case where
%can have different formulas with the same number of non-oxygen heteroatoms
%KL 1/6/09 - convert the results of getMATfile to double precision to get
%the right answer in the mass calculations! and added a line to Check7GR to
%require all elements to be positive (bc can't have negative number of
%elements in a compound, so why allow it)
%KL 1/17/09 findformula_uselist_KL7_SPsort - Still finding too much S and P
%- at the expense of N, try sorting to bias against S and P, but not N
%this involves changes both in the useMATfile function embedded and in the
%loops for building at the higher masses
%KL 1/20/09 - had a requirement that to keep a new peak, has to be within
%half of the given formula_error if there already is an old formula IF the
%formula is a comparison bw an existing formula found through the relations
%and a new formula found with the database (previously brute force)
%KL 4/15/09 - IF there is more than one formula, cap the number of S and P, 
%and then select based on lowest number of N, S, and P (sortType =
%'HA_cap') (will also test an overall cap on the number of S and P). Also,
%get rid of the relation which switches H for Na (will deal with that
%later)
%KL 4/30/09 - cleaning up, and changing the names of the sortTypes
%KL 5/1/09 - only change is to correct the neutral mass check bc sent out
%the wrong version yesterday
%KL 5/11/09 - changing the neutral mass check yet again
%KL 9/23/09 - change useMATfile to send out startform as double precision
%KL 9/1/2011 - correcting problem found by Dan Baluha (Univ. of Maryland)
%where in one of the calculations, the error calculation was multiplied by
%1e-6, rather than 1e6, therefore the error calculations were off by 1e-12.
%KL 4/22/2015 - Nikola Tolic (PNNL) found an error in the formula checking
%where we reference the wrong mass. v14 corrects that error
%KL 4/28/2015 - Andrey Liyu (PNNL) found an error in how I was embedding the
%functions. I had the 'end' in the wrong place to close out findformula and
%as such the embedded functions were nested functions. This version
%corrects that to make them local functions (and hence *not* able to access
%variables outside the function).
%KL 11/2/2016  correcting bug that ignored valence state of P in Check7GR
%KL 11/29/2016 correcting error in the implementation of the SENIOR rule 

%check to be sure there are two variables going out
if nargout~=2
    error('Are you sure the right number of variables are going out?')
end


% check to make sure the masses are neutral masses
%KL 5/11/09 - change to if the masses have been corrected to neutral masses
%there should be more rounded numbers which are even numbers
ro = round(peak_mass); %first get the rounded masses
rm = mod(ro,2); %gets 1 = odd, 2 = even
even = length(find(rm == 0));
odd = length(find(rm == 1));
if odd > even
    error('Are you sure the masses have been converted to neutral masses?')
