# What are the variables in the *mat file?

The important variables (you can ignore the others generated by R.matlab)

_NameOfFile_	This is the name of the *mat file you have

_EICdata_	The extracted ion chromatograms for the entire sample set. The number of rows matches the number of features in the dataset, where a feature is a unique combination of m/z and retention time. The number of columns matches the number of samples in the dataset.

_Peaks_	This has the same number of rows as EIC data and is the list of m/z values associated with each feature.

_RT_	This has the same number of rows as EIC data and is the list of retention times (in seconds) values associated with each feature.

We often call the combination of Peaks and RT a 'feature', or an 'mzRT feature'. These are analogous to OTUs in biology. The EICdata contains the peak area for each mzRT feature, which is a measure of relative abundance.
