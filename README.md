# NEplants
Plant project with Northeastern University\
Getting started, Krista Longnecker, 31 May 2023

4 June 2023\
Used this branch to process the data from the samples that were analyzed at WHOI on the Lumos in May 2023, and Krista Longnecker did the data analysis in June 2023. 

29 September 2023\
Move the NEplants_1 analysis to a branch that I can use the default branch for the next set of samples that were loaded on the Lumos in September 2023. One added note - I also changed the name of the raw data folder on the HPC for the first set of samples. It is now called NEplants1_wThresh. I did *not* update the code as I do not plan to rerun those samples.

Leave the file descriptions here in case they are useful later.

## Description of the files
The final set of files generated by this analysis can be analyzed in R/MATLAB/Python, and/or submitted to GNPS for molecular networking analysis. 
The final set of files will in the /output_dir/xcms2/ folder and are described as follows:

* 'SargPatch_untarg_{neg/pos}_aligned.csv'
  * This is the aligned set of mzRT features from the analysis, with one row per mzRT feature. In addition to information about mz value and retention time, there is one column for each sample with the peak areafor the sample
* 'SargPatch_untarg_{neg/pos}_picked.csv'
  * This is an unaligned list of mzRT features, these are not grouped into peaks by samples but can be useful for troubleshooting
* 'camera_{neg/pos}.csv'
  * This is the aligned set of mzRT features, with the adducts and isotopes determined from CAMERA. This is the best file to use in R/MATLAB/Python for downstream analysis
* 'edgelist_{neg/pos}.csv'
  * This is a list of edges that is needed for the GNPS analysis.
* 'fName_featureQuant_afterCAMERA_{neg/pos}.txt'
  * This is the aligned list of mzRT features, with CAMERA information, in a format that can be submitted to GNPS.
* 'fName_featureQuant_all_{neg/pos}.txt'
  * This is a feature table, mzRT information and peak areas for samples, in a format that can be submitted to GNPS. This version includes all mzRT features.
* 'fName_featureQuant_combined_{neg/pos}.txt'
  * This is feature table, mzRT information and peak areas for samples, in a format that can be submitted to GNPS. In this datafile, only features with MS2 information are included
* 'ms2spectra_all_{neg/pos}.mgf'
  * This is an mgf file, which can be submitted to GNPS; this version contains every MS2 spectra 
* 'ms2spectra_combined_{neg/pos}.mgf'
  * This is an mgf file, which can be submitted to GNPS; this version combines MS2 spectra based on the metric set at step 4.

Note that the {neg/pos} in the file name indicates that two files are produced - one for negative ion mode and one for positive ion mode.
